=============

Basic charts in go.

The following chart types are implemented:
 - Strip Charts
 - Scatter / Function-Plot Charts
 - Histograms
 - Bar and Categorical Bar Charts
 - Pie/Ring Charts

Still missing are:
 - Q-Q Plots
 - Trellis Plots

Package chart itself provideds the charts/plots itself, the charts/plots
can be output to different graphic devices/drivers.  Currently only
 - txt (ASCII art charts)
 - svg (scalable vector graphics via github.com/ajstarks/svgo)
are implemented.  Still missing (but to come):
 - cairo (via bitbucket.org/dethe/gocairo)
